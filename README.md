Bible Parsing Library for the Terminal

# Motive:

The ambition behind this project is moreso a learning exercise if nothing else.
Due to me learning Java as part of my Universtiy degree, I wanted to be able to do something extra curricular with the language and at the same time, pertaining towards my Faith in Catholicism.

Therefore, I have decided to work on a Parsing Library for reading the Bible in the Terminal, selecting from a range of Verses, amongst other various features.

```God Bless you all!```

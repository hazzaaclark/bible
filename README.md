# Motive:

The ambition behind this project is moreso a learning exercise if nothing else.
Due to me learning Java as part of my Universtiy degree, I wanted to be able to do something extra curricular with the language and at the same time, pertaining towards my Faith in Catholicism.

Therefore, I have decided to work on a Parsing Library for reading the Bible in the Terminal, selecting from a range of Verses, amongst other various features.

```God Bless you all!```

# Building:

While there is no intuitive way to build it locally as of right now, the best thing to do would be to git clone this repo, run it through vs code's debugger, and go from there.

# Usage:

Currently works with the provided ``KJV.xml`` file, will look into modular expansion for dynamic reading of XML files to discern between versions
